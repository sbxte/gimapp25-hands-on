lore = Array[String](["Hairless, regal, and perpetually dramatic, Overlord Bingus rules the Felis Dominion with the confidence of a creature who knows he is warm because his heart burns bright. His cape glows faintly with arcane doodle-runes, and he claims this is because “fur would only dim my brilliance.” Despite his grand speeches, he is incredibly soft and demands blankets like a royal tribute. Legends say his magical aura comes from the far land of the Warmspire Dunes.", "A swirl of orange, black, and white, the Sorceress is said to carry three destinies in her coat—and she switches between them depending on her mood. Her magic flows like watercolor, unpredictable but beautiful, capable of turning enemy spells into butterflies, or perhaps bombs depending on the day. True to her blood, Capriccio rarity and feisty charm, she is one-of-a-kind: wise, whimsical and only slightly dangerous when someone wakes up from a nap.", "Silent paws, shimmering eyes, and a shadow that moves even when they don't—The Void is the embodiment of Dark Magic. Feared by foes but adored by teammates, they bring luck or ruin depending on whether they feel like purring. The blood of Victusa were always misunderstood; here, their mystique become raw power. Whenever they walk, ink drips upward, stars flicker in their fur.", "Vibrant as a crackling vampire, the Ranger of Emberstripe is bold, chatty and never misses a shot—except when distracted by snacks. His striped coat resembles ancient hunting markings said to bless him with uncanny accuracy. He takes pride in proving others wrong regarding the stigma of Emberstripe…. Sometimes… when he remembers. His longbow is carved from an enchanted cardboard, flexible yet unbreakable.", "Swift, precise and slightly bossy, the Sentinel of Crestglow fires bolts with mechanical grace. Her coat symbolize balance and warmth of the Terrace. Though the Dawnstripes are known for being affectionate, she expresses love by correcting everyone’s form and reminding the Rangers they are holding the bow upside down.", "Tall, pale and elegant. The Guardians of Luminara glows faintly in the moonlight like a blessing from the Paper Gods themselves. Sensitive to sunlight but fearless in battle, he fields a spear twice his size, moving with an icy precision that astonishes allies and strikes fear into the opponent. The Moonpale Paws grants him ethereal beauty—and the tendency to hiss dramatically, when it’s too bright outside. A gentle soul, he often apologizes after skewering enemies.", "Sleek, muscular and loud enough to shake a fortress, the Wardens strides forward with booming war-cries that sound suspiciously like complaints. Known for their vocal nature, Wardens of Azurecall  channel that trait into battlefield intimidation. Clad in armor etched with Gouthic markings, he defends teammates with unwavering loyalty—while also narrating every moment like a dramatic opera singer.", "With a thick, luxurious coat and a tail large enough to be used as a blanket. The Minstrels of Verdantwood are a walking festival. His voice is deep and soothing, able to charm allies, lull enemies to sleep, or start spontaneous sing-alongs. True to the Grandtail Blood giant reputation, he is friendly, enormous and slightly unaware of his size—often crushing instruments simply by sitting on them. His lute is reinforced. For reasons… of course.", "Calm, plush and beautifully round, the Mooncot Priestesses radiate tranquility like a living cushion of divine widow. Her fur has a soft, silvery sheen that many believe is moon-blessed, granting her healing magic that feels like being wrapped in a warm blanket. Reserved but endlessly caring, she embodies the Silverquil Monastery reputation for quiet loyalty—offering guidance, comfort, and the occasional headbonk of holy encouragement.", "The Doberman is a German breed of medium-large working dog of pinscher type. It was originally bred in Thuringia in about 1890 by Louis Dobermann, a tax collector. It has a long muzzle and – ideally – an even and graceful gait. The ears were traditionally cropped and the tail docked, practices which are now illegal in many countries."])
